# Feature Flags - Basestack

What is Feature Flags - Basestack?

Basestack is a platform that helps manage Feature/Toggle Flags. It offers a unique way to test new features during development without causing any issues in production. With feature flags, developers and product creators can safely release untested features or try out new ideas in different environments. It gives you more control and flexibility in how you develop your projects.

Easily test specific features of your projects with your users using our platform. We provide a user-friendly interface for creating flags, along with support for various plug-and-play SDKs tailored to your projects. It's a seamless way to experiment and gather feedback on your new features.
