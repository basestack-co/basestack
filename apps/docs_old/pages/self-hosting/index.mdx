# Deployment Overview & Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Each service from Basestack is designed to be self-hosted and run
  independently. This page provides the necessary information to deploy and
  configure each service. While most configurations are common across all
  services, specific configurations unique to each service can be found at the
  end of this page.
</Callout>

Getting up and running is an easy with various options available. Simply ensure you have a Postgres database and a server that can run Node.js. Customize all the settings of the Basestack Platform by referring to the detailed configuration provided below.

## App hosting

You have the flexibility to host the platform on any service capable of hosting [NextJS ↗](https://nextjs.org/?ref=basestack.co) applications with serverless function support. Additionally, you'll need a separate database running elsewhere that the app can connect to. Some app hosting providers that support include Vercel, more coming, all of which offer a free tier option.

  <Cards.Card title="Netlify" href="/self-hosting/providers/deploy-netlify" />
  <Cards.Card title="Render" href="/self-hosting/providers/deploy-render" />
</Cards>

## Managed databases

Ensure that the PostgreSQL service or instance supports serverless environments. Any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/?ref=basestack.co), will work effectively.

## Environment Variables

The platform has a straightforward configuration process, requiring a set of essential environment variables to configure the services and run the platform smoothly.

### Database Configuration

| Property              | Description                                               | Required |

| Property      | Description                                                                 | Required | Example                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens. | true     | [generate](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32?ref=basestack.co) |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`    | Set to the canonical URL of your site                                       | true     | https://your-basestack-instance.com                                |

#### Providers

Authentication Providers in the Platform are services that you and your team can use for signing in. To find the list of supported providers, check below:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can have multiple Auth providers on the platform, providing you with more
  options. However, it is essential to configure at least one Auth provider for
  the platform to function properly.

- [Google Configuration](/self-hosting/authentication/google-config)

### API Configuration

The configurations relevant to the API are associated with the endpoint from the `REST API`, which enables tasks like fetching the Flags. On the other hand, services concerning the dashboard, members, and permissions are safeguarded by Authentication and can only be accessed from the same origin (CORS).

#### CORS Configuration

We highly recommend securing the `REST API` requests to ensure they originate from the same domain as your services. You can modify the variables below to align with your product domains.

| Property                          | Description                                                                             | Required | Example |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `API_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | Indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin | false    | \*      |

### Email Configuration

The Basestack Platform uses SMTP for sending emails. To configure SMTP, set the following environment variables:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Why [UpStash ↗](https://upstash.com/?ref=basestack.co)? Since the Basestack
  Platform can run in serverless environments, using a service like UpStash
  QStash to handle background jobs is essential. QStash is a service designed to
  handle task scheduling and message queuing in a serverless environment. It’s
  particularly useful for serverless or edge applications that need to offload
  tasks asynchronously or schedule them for future execution.
