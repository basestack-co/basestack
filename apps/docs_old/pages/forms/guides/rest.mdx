# REST API Integration

A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized interface that allows systems to communicate over HTTP by adhering to REST principles. It uses stateless operations and standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, typically represented in JSON or XML formats.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    You can use the REST API with any backend, framework, or library for which we don’t provide an example. Simply use
    your favorite tools.
</Callout>

To get started, you’ll need the following:

- A [Basestack Forms](https://forms.basestack.co) Account
- Any library, framework, or language that supports HTTP calls


<Steps>

    ### Use the CURL command to send form data to the endpoint.

    Ensure the mode is set to `mode=rest to retrieve the response in JSON format.


    ### Execute the following command in your terminal.

    You can use the CURL command below to send a test submission.


    ```bash copy
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "John Doe", "message": "Hello World"}' \
    "https://forms.basestack.co/api/v1/s/[KEY]?mode=rest"
    ```
