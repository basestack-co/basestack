# How to Contribute

First and foremost, thank you for dedicating your time to enhance the platform. We warmly welcome all contributions. We appreciate your support in making our platform even better!

Before creating a PR, let's [discuss](https://github.com/basestack-co/basestack/discussions) your implementation ideas if you have any uncertainties regarding the requirements or vision of Basestack. We value collaboration and want to ensure a smooth process for your contributions. Feel free to reach out, and let's work together to make Basestack even better!

The project is a Monorepo powered by [Turborepo ↗](https://turborepo.org/), which enhances the development process. The project follows the following main structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="docs" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="feature-flags" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="forms" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="design-system" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="hooks" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="config files" />
</FileTree>

## Initial Requirements

<Steps>
  ### Create a database
  Ensure that you have an operational PostgreSQL database server running on your local machine. If you are using a Mac, you can use a tool like [Postgres.app ↗](https://postgresapp.com/) to quickly get started and create databases.

### Authentication

Use [Github ↗](https://github.com/) as the authentication provider, and create a new [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) by filling out the form with the following settings:

```bash
"Application name": "Feature Flags by Basestack"
"Homepage URL": "http://localhost:3000"
"Authorization callback URL": "http://localhost:3000"
```

</Steps>

## Getting started

<Steps>
  ### To get started, fork the Platform.

To begin, fork the [Basestack Platform repository](https://github.com/basestack-co/basestack) to your GitHub account, and subsequently, clone it to your local machine.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  To configure the Environment Variables file in the project, refer to the
  [Configuration Page](/feature-flags/deployment#environment-variables). Each
  app can have its own `env` file; however, this guide specifically pertains to
  the Feature Flags App.
</Callout>

### Create a new branch to start working on your changes.

```sh copy
git checkout -b FEAT_BRANCH_NAME
```

### To run the project locally, follow these steps:

##### 1 - To install the dependencies, use the following command:

```sh copy
yarn install
```

##### 2 - Configure the environment variables for Feature Flags as follows:

```sh

DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

# Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations

# See more documentation here: https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx"


# Check for the full list of environment variables in the .env.example file on each app.
```

##### 3 - Build the project using the following command:
