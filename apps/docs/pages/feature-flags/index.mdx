<FAQBox title="What are the requirements for self-hosting" isOpen={false}>
  Any service that can host a [NextJS ↗](https://nextjs.org/) applications with
  serverless function support and provide a Postgres database compatible with
  serverless environments will work seamlessly. Consider services such as [Neon
  ↗](https://neon.tech), [Supabase ↗](https://supabase.com/), or traditional
  Postgres with connection pooling like [PgBouncer
  ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What are the supported databases?" isOpen={false}>
  The platform uses PostgreSQL as the database. The crucial aspect here is to ensure that the PostgreSQL service or instance supports serverless environments. To facilitate the hosting of the Feature Flags Platform, we have some suggestions that can simplify the deployment process.

If you prefer not to use a third-party service, keep in mind that any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), will work effectively.
