# Feature Flags Platform

The Basestack Feature Flags is a self-hosting platform that offers a simple way to host your own Feature Flags management platform. The simplicity of hosting on services like Vercel allows any developer whether indie or in a startup to control their own features and control their own data. At the end of the day, the platform is housed in your account, in your services you control the data.

In this quick start we show how easy it is to host the platform at Vercel and with a Database hosted at Neon. All services shown in this quick start have perfect free plans to experience the platform and evolve from there

## Quick Start

### Deploy to Vercel

Quick deploy to [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) using the on-click-deploy button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FStorytics%2Fmonolock&env=DATABASE_URL,DIRECT_DATABASE_URL,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX,API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS,API_RATE_LIMIT_UNIQUE_TOKEN_PER_SECOND,API_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN&envDescription=Environment%20Variable%20Keys%20needed%20for%20Features%20Flags%20Platform&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.basestack.co%2F&project-name=basestack-feature-flags&repository-name=basestack-feature-flags)

[Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) will fork the
[Basestack Platform](https://github.com/Storytics/monolock) and
deploy the platform for you. Once done, every commit in the fork repository will be
deployed automatically, this will be important to control updates to the platform, to receive bugs fixes and new features.
