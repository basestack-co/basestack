# Deploy to Vercel

[Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) is the company behind the Next.js framework, which is used by Basestack. [Vercel Pricing ↗](https://vercel.com/pricing) also offers a free hosting service perfectly suited for Next.js applications. Continue with the steps below to get started deploying the platform to your account and begin creating new flags.

In this quick start guide, we demonstrate just how effortless it is to host the platform on [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/), complemented by a Database hosted at [Neon ↗](https://neon.tech/). Best of all, both services offer perfect free plans, allowing you to explore the platform and scale up as you progress.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  To receive updates from the main repository, you will need to manually fork
  the project to your account (e.g., GitHub) and import it manually into your
  Vercel account dashboard. The rest of the process remains the same in terms of
  configuration, such as Environment Variables and Project Settings. For more
  details, refer to the [Getting Updates
  Page](/feature-flags/deployment/updates).
</Callout>

## Getting started

<Steps>
  ### To begin, create a database.

Ensure that you have an operational PostgreSQL database server capable of accepting remote connections.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as
  [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), will work effectively.
</Callout>

If you do not already have a database, consider selecting one from the recommended list below:

- [Neon - Serverless Postgres](/feature-flags/guides/database/neon)

  During the deployment step, you will be prompted to provide two environment variables for the database. The first is `DATABASE_URL`, which is the Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer. The second is `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`, which serves as the direct connection URL to the database, used for migrations.

### Next, set up authentication.

To simplify this guide, we will use [Github ↗](https://github.com/) as the authentication provider, allowing you to create an account and log in to the Platform. Additionally, this setup will allow other members of your organization to log in as well.

**Create a new [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) by filling out the form with the following settings:**

{" "}

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you don't have a Project URL yet, you can leave it blank for now. Check out
  the [Troubleshooting
  section](/feature-flags/deployment/deploy-vercel#i-still-dont-have-a-project-domain-or-url)
  for further assistance.
</Callout>

```bash
"Application name": "Feature Flags by Basestack"
"Homepage URL": "https://your-basestack-instance.com"
"Authorization callback URL": "https://your-basestack-instance.com/api/auth/callback/github"
```

Once you've successfully created a new [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers), it will generate two important keys: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. Be sure to save these keys for later use during the deployment step, as they will be needed as environment variables.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  For more granular control over authentication aspects, including rules,
  enabling or disabling account creation, and allowing account creation with
  credentials (email and password), we recommend using
  [Auth0](/feature-flags/guides/authentication/auth0-config).
</Callout>

### Finally, proceed with the deployment.

#### Quick Deploy (Skip this if you want to receive updates)

Quick deploy to [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) with a simple click on the deploy button below:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FStorytics%2Fmonolock&env=DATABASE_URL,DIRECT_DATABASE_URL,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,API_RATE_LIMIT_MAX,API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS,API_RATE_LIMIT_UNIQUE_TOKEN_PER_SECOND,API_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN&envDescription=Environment%20Variable%20Keys%20needed%20for%20Features%20Flags%20Platform&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.basestack.co%2F&project-name=basestack-feature-flags&repository-name=basestack-feature-flags)

By clicking on the button above, a new repository will be created in your Git account (e.g., GitHub) from the [Basestack Platform](https://github.com/Storytics/monolock) repository, and the platform will be deployed for you. This will be an independent copy with no connection to the main project.

#### Fork the Platform

Alternatively, you have the option to manually fork the [Basestack Platform repository](https://github.com/Storytics/monolock). This provides greater control over [updates](/feature-flags/deployment/updates) and even allows you to [contribute](/contributing) to the project if desired.

#### Environment Variables

To ensure a successful deployment on Vercel, the platform requires a minimum set of environment variables. Below is the list of environment variables that you must fill in. For the complete list of Environment Variables, please refer to the [Configuration Page](/feature-flags/deployment#environment-variables).

| Property               | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.                                            |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`  | Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations                                   |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`      | Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens.                 |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`         | Set to the canonical URL of your site                                                       |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`     | Client Id generated in the [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) creation     |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret generated in the [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) creation |

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or
  generate a [random value](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).
</Callout>

#### Vercel Project Settings

In your new Project Settings on Vercel, navigate to the **Build & Development Settings** section and complete the form with the following settings:

```bash
  "Build Command": "yarn deploy:feature-flags"
  "Output Directory": "apps/feature-flags/.next"
  "Install Command": "yarn install"
  "Development Command": "next"
```

</Steps>

## What's next?

Begin by familiarizing yourself with the platform. Create projects, add new feature flags, invite members, and implement the feature flags in your product using our official SDKs.

Lastly, stay tuned about updates, including new features and bug fixes. To ensure your platform is always up-to-date with the latest improvements, refer to our guide on updating the platform by visiting the [Updates Page](/feature-flags/deployment/updates).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  For more comprehensive information about the deployment process, please check
  out the [Configuration Page](/feature-flags/deployment). This page provides
  detailed guidance to ensure a successful and seamless deployment of the
  Feature Flags Platform.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting

### I still don't have a Project domain or URL

If you don't have a domain yet, feel free to leave the fields below empty or use dummy information. Proceed with the deployment as usual. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will generate a URL for your project.

Copy this URL and update the information in your [Github ↗](https://github.com/) [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers). Next, modify the environment variables in the project settings on Vercel and initiate a new deployment on Vercel once again.

**Environment Variables:**

- `NEXTAUTH_URL`

**Github [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) Fields:**

- `Homepage URL`
- `Authorization callback URL`
