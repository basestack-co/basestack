# Getting Updates

When you fork a platform, a copy of the code is created on your [Github ↗](https://github.com) account or any other Git-compatible service of your choice.

When a new release is made, your forked version will prompt you to fetch the latest updates. By pulling these changes into your copy and leveraging services like [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) with automatic releases, your hosted version will always have the most up-to-date features.

Additionally, you have the option to exercise control over the release process by disabling automatic releases on platforms like [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/). This allows you to thoroughly test new changes locally in your version and ensure they align with your desired outcome before manually making a release.

To receive the latest updates, start by pulling the changes from the Git repository:

```bash copy"
git pull
yarn install
yarn build
yarn dev
```
