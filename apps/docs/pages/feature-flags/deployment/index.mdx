# Deployment Overview & Configuration

Getting up and running is a easy with various options available. Simply ensure you have a Postgres database and a server that can run Node.js. Customize all the settings of the Feature Flags Platform by referring to the detailed configuration provided below.

## App hosting

You have the flexibility to host the platform on any service capable of hosting [NextJS ↗](https://nextjs.org/) applications with serverless function support. Additionally, you'll need a separate database running elsewhere that the app can connect to. Some app hosting providers that support include Vercel, more coming, all of which offer a free tier option.

## Managed databases

Ensure that the PostgreSQL service or instance supports serverless environments. Any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), will work effectively.

## Environment Variables

The platform boasts a straightforward configuration process, requiring a set of essential environment variables to configure the services and run the platform smoothly.

### Database Configuration

| Property              | Description                                               | Required |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.          | true     |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations | true     |

### Authentication Configuration

### General

For the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or generate a [random value](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).

| Property          | Description                                                                 | Required | Example                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens. | true     | [generate](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | Set to the canonical URL of your site                                       | true     | https://your-basestack-instance.com               |

### Providers

Authentication Providers in the Platform are services that you and your team can use for signing in. To find the list of supported providers, check below:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can have multiple Auth providers on the platform, providing you with more
  options. However, it is essential to configure at least one Auth provider for
  the platform to function properly.

- [Auth0 Configuration](/feature-flags/deployment/authentication/auth0-config)

#### Sentry Configuration

The Feature Flags Platform uses [Sentry ↗](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for error tracking. To configure Sentry, set the following environment variables:

| Property            | Description                                                                                        | Required |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `SENTRY_ORG`        | Organization slug in Sentry, identifying the account or organization context.                      | true     |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT`    | Project slug in Sentry, identifying the specific project within the organization.                  | true     |
| `SENTRY_DSN`        | Data Source Name (DSN) for Sentry, a unique identifier used to send events to Sentry.              | true     |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Authentication token for Sentry API access, providing authorized interaction with Sentry services. | true     |

### API Configuration

The configurations relevant to the API are associated with the endpoint from the [`REST API`](/feature-flags/sdks/rest-api), which enables tasks like fetching the Flags. On the other hand, services concerning the dashboard, members, and permissions are safeguarded by Authentication and can only be accessed from the same origin (CORS).

#### CORS Configuration

We highly recommend securing the [`REST API`](/feature-flags/sdks/rest-api) requests to ensure they originate from the same domain as your services. You can modify the variables below to align with your product domains.

| Property                          | Description                                                                             | Required | Example |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `API_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | Indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin | false    | \*      |

#### Email Configuration

The Forms Platform uses SMTP for sending emails. To configure SMTP, set the following environment variables:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can use any transactional email service, such as [SendGrid
  ↗](https://sendgrid.com/en-us), [Mailgun ↗](https://www.mailgun.com/), or
  [Resend ↗](https://resend.com) to send emails.

| `EMAIL_FROM`               | Sender email address used in outgoing emails.                                       | true     | `Hello. <hello@yourdomain.com>` |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`          | SMTP server hostname or IP address for sending emails.                              | true     |                                 |
