# Docs Theme

Nextra Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a
modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a
pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other built-in components.

This website itself is built with the Nextra Docs Theme.

## Quick Start from Template

### Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by
clicking the link:

<a
  className="mt-3 inline-flex"
  target="_blank"
  href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false"
>
  ![](https://vercel.com/button)
</a>

Vercel will fork the
[Nextra Docs template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template) and
deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be
deployed automatically.

### Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the
[template repository](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

## Start as New Project

<Steps>
  ### Install

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**,
**React**, **Nextra**, and **Nextra Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run
the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh copy npm2yarn
npm i next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

<Callout>
  If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to
  install `nextra` and `nextra-theme-docs` as the add-ons.
</Callout>

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```js copy filename="next.config.js"
const withNextra = require("nextra")({
  theme: "nextra-theme-docs",
  themeConfig: "./theme.config.jsx",
});

module.exports = withNextra();

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js
project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in
[Guide](/docs/guide).

### Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your projectâ€™s root
directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx copy filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
  },
  // ...
};
```

Full theme configurations can be found
[here](/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Nextra

Hello, world!
```

And run the `pnpm next` command to start developing the project! ðŸŽ‰
