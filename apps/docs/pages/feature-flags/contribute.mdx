# How to Contribute

First and foremost, thank you for dedicating your time to enhance the platform. We warmly welcome all contributions. We appreciate your support in making our platform even better!

Before creating a PR, let's [discuss](https://github.com/Storytics/monolock/discussions) your implementation ideas if you have any uncertainties regarding the requirements or vision of Basestack. We value collaboration and want to ensure a smooth process for your contributions. Feel free to reach out, and let's work together to make Basestack even better!

The project is a Monorepo powered by [Turborepo ↗](https://turborepo.org/), which enhances the development process. The project follows the following main structure:
