# Neon Configuration Guide

[Neon ↗](https://neon.tech/) is an open-source serverless Postgres built for the cloud. It offers a contemporary developer experience by separating compute and storage, providing features like autoscaling, branching, bottomless storage, and more.

For detailed guidance on how to implement this, please follow the official links from the provider.

### Database URL vs Direct Database URL

Our platform requires a direct connection to the database for conducting migrations. To avoid encountering migrations issues, make sure you are using a direct connection to the database for migrations. Neon supports both pooled and direct connections to the same database, which can be added in the Environment Variables for deploying our platform.

You should be able to retrieve from Neon project dashboard the following connections examples:

```sh
DATABASE_URL="postgres://daniel:<password>@ep-restless-rice-862380-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgres://daniel:<password>@ep-restless-rice-862380.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech:5432/neondb"
```

### Environment Variables

| Property              | Description                                               | Required |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.          | true     |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations | true     |
