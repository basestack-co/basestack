# Deployment Overview & Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Each service from Basestack is designed to be self-hosted and run
  independently. This page provides the necessary information to deploy and
  configure each service. While most configurations are common across all
  services, specific configurations unique to each service can be found at the
  end of this page.
</Callout>

Getting up and running is an easy with various options available. Simply ensure you have a Postgres database and a server that can run Node.js. Customize all the settings of the Basestack Platform by referring to the detailed configuration provided below.

## App hosting

You have the flexibility to host the platform on any service capable of hosting [NextJS ↗](https://nextjs.org/) applications with serverless function support. Additionally, you'll need a separate database running elsewhere that the app can connect to. Some app hosting providers that support include Vercel, more coming, all of which offer a free tier option.

  <Card title="Netlify" href="/self-hosting/providers/deploy-netlify" />
  <Card title="Render" href="/self-hosting/providers/deploy-render" />
</Cards>

## Managed databases

Ensure that the PostgreSQL service or instance supports serverless environments. Any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), will work effectively.

## Environment Variables

The platform has a straightforward configuration process, requiring a set of essential environment variables to configure the services and run the platform smoothly.

### Database Configuration

| Property              | Description                                               | Required |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.          | true     |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations | true     |

### Authentication Configuration

### General

For the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or generate a [random value](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).

| Property          | Description                                                                 | Required | Example                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens. | true     | [generate](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | Set to the canonical URL of your site                                       | true     | https://your-basestack-instance.com               |

### Providers

Authentication Providers in the Platform are services that you and your team can use for signing in. To find the list of supported providers, check below:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can have multiple Auth providers on the platform, providing you with more
  options. However, it is essential to configure at least one Auth provider for
  the platform to function properly.
</Callout>

- [Auth0 Configuration](/self-hosting/authentication/auth0-config)

#### Sentry Configuration

The Basestack Platform uses [Sentry ↗](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for error tracking. To configure Sentry, set the following environment variables:

| Property            | Description                                                                                        | Required |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `SENTRY_ORG`        | Organization slug in Sentry, identifying the account or organization context.                      | true     |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT`    | Project slug in Sentry, identifying the specific project within the organization.                  | true     |
| `SENTRY_DSN`        | Data Source Name (DSN) for Sentry, a unique identifier used to send events to Sentry.              | true     |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Authentication token for Sentry API access, providing authorized interaction with Sentry services. | true     |

### API Configuration

The configurations relevant to the API are associated with the endpoint from the `REST API`, which enables tasks like fetching the Flags. On the other hand, services concerning the dashboard, members, and permissions are safeguarded by Authentication and can only be accessed from the same origin (CORS).

#### CORS Configuration

We highly recommend securing the `REST API` requests to ensure they originate from the same domain as your services. You can modify the variables below to align with your product domains.

| Property                          | Description                                                                             | Required | Example |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `API_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN` | Indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin | false    | \*      |

#### Email Configuration

The Basestack Platform uses SMTP for sending emails. To configure SMTP, set the following environment variables:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can use any transactional email service, such as [SendGrid
  ↗](https://sendgrid.com/en-us), [Mailgun ↗](https://www.mailgun.com/), or
  [Resend ↗](https://resend.com) to send emails.
</Callout>

| Property                   | Description                                                                         | Required | Example                         |

#### Platform-Specific Configuration

The above environment variables are common across all platforms. However, there are specific configurations unique to each platform. Below are the configurations for each platform:

  <Tabs.Tab>
    No specific configurations are required for Feature Flags.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>

    #### Background Jobs Configuration

    Because the Forms Platform uses background jobs to handle tasks such as sending emails, you need to configure the following environment variables:

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Why [Trigger.dev ↗](https://trigger.dev/)? Since the Basestack Platform can
      run in serverless environments, using a service like Trigger.dev to handle
      background jobs is essential. Trigger.dev enables the creation of long-running
      jobs and is our choice because it is open-source. Alternatively, you can use
      their cloud service, which offers a free plan.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
      Basestack Forms currently uses Trigger.dev v2, with plans to migrate to v3
      once it is stable. You can easily self-host Trigger.dev v2 using this
      [Trigger.dev Template on Railway.app ↗](https://railway.app/template/na6kUS).
    </Callout>

    | Property                             | Description                                                                                 | Required |
    | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
    | `TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID`                 | You can find your project's ID on your Trigger.dev instance dashboard.                      | true     |
    | `TRIGGER_API_KEY`                    | Find the key for your environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) on the Trigger.dev dashboard.        | true     |
    | `TRIGGER_API_URL`                    | The URL where your Trigger.dev instance is running (self-hosted or cloud)                   | true     |

    #### Cloudflare API Configuration

    The Forms Platform uses Cloudflare services, including Cloudflare AI for spam detection. To configure the Cloudflare API, set the following environment variables:

    | Property                | Description                                                | Required | Example                                                                                                                |

    #### Payments Configuration

    The Forms Platform uses [LemonSqueezy ↗](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/) for payments. To configure [LemonSqueezy ↗](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/), set the following environment variables:

    | Property                        | Description                                                                                           | Required |
