# JavaScript Integration

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive features on websites. It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables both client-side and server-side development.

To get started, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A [Basestack Forms](https://forms.basestack.co) Account
- A JavaScript project with a Form

<Steps>

### Use this on your JavaScript Project to send form data to your endpoint.

Send data using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) or Any [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) client and ensure the mode on the query string is set to `mode=rest` for retrieving the response in JSON format.

### Copy and paste this into your JavaScript file.

Feel free to use the code below to send a test submission.

```js copy
try {
  const res = await fetch("https://forms.basestack.co/api/v1/s/[KEY]?mode=rest", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Accept: "application/json",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ name: "John Doe", message: "Hello World" }),
  });

  const data = await res.json();

  if (data.code === 200) {
    console.log("Form submitted successfully");
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error submitting form", error);
}
```

</Steps>
