# Deployment Overview & Configuration

Getting up and running is an easy with various options available. Simply ensure you have a Postgres database and a server that can run Node.js. Customize all the settings of the Forms Platform by referring to the detailed configuration provided below.

## App hosting

You have the flexibility to host the platform on any service capable of hosting [NextJS ↗](https://nextjs.org/) applications with serverless function support. Additionally, you'll need a separate database running elsewhere that the app can connect to. Some app hosting providers that support include Vercel, more coming, all of which offer a free tier option.

</Cards>

## Managed databases

Ensure that the PostgreSQL service or instance supports serverless environments. Any traditional instance of PostgreSQL with connection pooling, such as [PgBouncer ↗](https://www.pgbouncer.org/), will work effectively.

## Environment Variables

The platform boasts a straightforward configuration process, requiring a set of essential environment variables to configure the services and run the platform smoothly.

### Database Configuration

| Property              | Description                                               | Required |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.          | true     |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations | true     |

### Authentication Configuration

### General

For the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` variable you can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or generate a [random value ↗](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32).

| Property          | Description                                                                 | Required | Example                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Used to encrypt the NextAuth.js JWT, and to hash email verification tokens. | true     | [generate ↗](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | Set to the canonical URL of your site                                       | true     | https://your-basestack-instance.com                  |

### Providers

Authentication Providers in the Platform are services that you and your team can use for signing in. To find the list of supported providers, check below:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can have multiple Auth providers on the platform, providing you with more
  options. However, it is essential to configure at least one Auth provider for
  the platform to function properly.

- [Auth0 Configuration](/forms/deployment/authentication/auth0-config)

#### Background Jobs Configuration

Because the Forms Platform uses background jobs to handle tasks such as sending emails, you need to configure the following environment variables:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Why [Trigger.dev ↗](https://trigger.dev/)? Since the Basestack Platform can
  run in serverless environments, using a service like Trigger.dev to handle
  background jobs is essential. Trigger.dev enables the creation of long-running
  jobs and is our choice because it is open-source. Alternatively, you can use
  their cloud service, which offers a free plan.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ℹ️">
  Basestack Forms currently uses Trigger.dev v2, with plans to migrate to v3
  once it is stable. You can easily self-host Trigger.dev v2 using this
  [Trigger.dev Template on Railway.app ↗](https://railway.app/template/na6kUS).

| `TRIGGER_API_KEY`                    | Find the key for your environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) on the Trigger.dev dashboard.        | true     |
| `TRIGGER_API_URL`                    | The URL where your Trigger.dev instance is running (self-hosted or cloud)                   | true     |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIGGER_PUBLIC_API_KEY` | Find the public key for your environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) on the Trigger.dev dashboard. | true     |

#### Cloudflare API Configuration

The Forms Platform uses Cloudflare services, including Cloudflare AI for spam detection. To configure the Cloudflare API, set the following environment variables:

| Property                | Description                                                | Required | Example                                                                                                                |
