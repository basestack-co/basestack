A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standardized interface that allows systems to communicate over HTTP by adhering to REST principles. It uses stateless operations and standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, typically represented in JSON or XML formats.
