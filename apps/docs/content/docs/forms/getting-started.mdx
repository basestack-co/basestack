            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <!-- name each of your inputs as you wish -->
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
        </div>

        <!-- your other form fields go here -->
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <Step>

    ### Integrate your HTML Form with Basestack Forms

    to start collecting submissions.

    ```html copy
    <!-- modify this form HTML as you wish -->
    <form action="[https://forms.basestack.co/api/v1/s/[KEY]?mode=rest" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <div>
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <!-- name each of your inputs as you wish -->
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
        </div>

        <div>
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
        </div>

        <!-- your other form fields go here -->
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    ```

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
        All input fields (e.g., input, textarea, etc) must have a **name** attribute, or Basestack Forms won’t be able
        to collect.
    </Callout>
</Step>
