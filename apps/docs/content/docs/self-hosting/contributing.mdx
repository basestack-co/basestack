First and foremost, thank you for dedicating your time to enhance the platform. We warmly welcome all contributions. We appreciate your support in making our platform even better!

Before creating a PR, let's [discuss](https://github.com/basestack-co/basestack/discussions) your implementation ideas if you have any uncertainties regarding the requirements or vision of Basestack. We value collaboration and want to ensure a smooth process for your contributions. Feel free to reach out, and let's work together to make Basestack even better!

The project is a Monorepo powered by [Turborepo ↗](https://turborepo.org/?ref=basestack.co), which enhances the development process. The project follows the following main structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="docs" />
    <Folder name="feature-flags" />
    <Folder name="forms" />
    <Folder name="..." />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="design-system" />
    <Folder name="hooks" />
    <Folder name="..." />
  </Folder>
  <File name="config files" />
</Files>

## Initial Requirements

<Steps>

<Step>
  ### Create a database
  Ensure that you have an operational PostgreSQL database server running on your local machine. If you are using a Mac, you can use a tool like [Postgres.app ↗](https://postgresapp.com/?ref=basestack.co) to quickly get started and create databases.

### Authentication

Use [Github ↗](https://github.com/) as the authentication provider, and create a new [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers/?ref=basestack.co) by filling out the form with the following settings:

```bash
"Application name": "Feature Flags by Basestack"
"Homepage URL": "http://localhost:3000"
"Authorization callback URL": "http://localhost:3000"
```

</Step>

## Getting started

<Step>
  ### To get started, fork the Platform.

To begin, fork the [Basestack Platform repository](https://github.com/basestack-co/basestack) to your GitHub account, and subsequently, clone it to your local machine.

<Callout type="info">
  To configure the Environment Variables file in the project, refer to the
  [Configuration Page](/content/self-hosting#environment-variables). Each app
  can have its own `env` file; however, this guide specifically pertains to the
  Feature Flags App.
</Callout>

### Create a new branch to start working on your changes.

```sh copy
git checkout -b FEAT_BRANCH_NAME
```

### To run the project locally, follow these steps:

##### 1 - To install the dependencies, use the following command:

```sh copy
yarn install
```

##### 2 - Configure the environment variables for Feature Flags as follows:

```sh
copy apps/feature-flags/.env.example to apps/feature-flags/.env
```

Example:

```sh copy title=".env"
# DATABASE

# Connection URL to your database using PgBouncer.
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

# Direct connection URL to the database used for migrations
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

# AUTHENTICATION

# generate a https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="b923d5f6f5a06e99ad97f8b99ea57741"
BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# AUTHENTICATION - GITHUB
# BetterAuth with GitHub as a provider
# See more documentation here: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/github
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="xxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx"


# Check for the full list of environment variables in the .env.example file on each app.
```

##### 3 - Build the project using the following command:

```sh copy
yarn build
```

##### 4 - Run the project by executing the following command:

```sh copy
yarn dev
