When you fork a platform, a copy of the code is created on your [Github ↗](https://github.com/?ref=basestack.co) account. When a new release is made, your forked version will prompt you to fetch the latest updates. By pulling these changes into your copy and leveraging services like [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/) with automatic releases, your hosted version will always have the most up-to-date features.

Additionally, you have the option to control over the release process by disabling automatic releases on platforms like [Vercel ↗](https://vercel.com/?ref=basestack.co). This allows you to thoroughly test new changes locally and ensure they align with your desired outcome before manually making a release.

- To receive the latest updates, pull the changes in your local machine or use the GitHub dashboard to sync with the main repository.

  To test these new features on your local machine before deciding whether to
  deploy, refer to the [How to Contribute](/content/self-hosting/contributing#getting-started) page
  for instructions on running the platform locally. This will allow you to
  explore and evaluate the changes before making any deployment decisions.
