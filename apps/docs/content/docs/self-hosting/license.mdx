Basestack is an open-source project licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 ([AGPLv3 â†—](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html?ref=basestack.co)).

Its three most important points are:

- Source Code Availability: AGPLv3 mandates that the complete source code of the software be made accessible to users whenever the software is distributed or accessed over a network.
- Copyleft Provisions: AGPLv3 is a strong copyleft license, which means that any modifications or derivative works based on AGPLv3-licensed software must also be released under AGPLv3, preserving the open-source nature of the project.
- "Affero" Clause: The license addresses the "ASP loophole," requiring web-based services that use AGPLv3-licensed software to provide users with access to the corresponding source code, ensuring transparency and sharing within the open-source community.
